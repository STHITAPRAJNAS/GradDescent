# GradDescent
MATLAB implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm for Multivariable Linear Regression. 
This code example includes,
* Feature scaling option
* Choice of algorithm termination based on either gradient norm tolerance or fixed number of iterations
* Randomized feature vector with randomized exponents (the exact functional relationship is not linear bu with random powers of feature vectors)
* Choice of number of observations and features
* Choice of 'learning rate' and number of iterations
* Final table of actual functional coefficients and linear regression coefficients side by side
* Various plot options
